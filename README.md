# Go Design Patterns

This repo is to document all the examples and learnings as I learn about design patterns using golang. 

## What is design pattern?

Patterns are typical solutions to common occuring problems in programming. Unlike algorithm which gives you excat steps design patterns provides blueprint that allows you to tailor your implementation. The idea of design pattern was popularised by a book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Objet-Oriented Software* which is popularly know as *gang of four book*. The book has 23 patters divided into different catogeries but I intend to start from the six most common ones and migth add more later. 

## What are the benefits of patterns and why to learn them?

Design patterns are battle tested wisdom that can be used during software design. Knowing the patterns allows usage of tried and tested solution encountered during software development. Knowledge of patterns allows to uderstand how code is written in a way it is. It is useful for efficient communication between developers because of a common understand of how thing is done. 

Patterns are criticized for being unecessary if programming languages are well designed and appropiately choosen. There are also many innefficent implementation arising from trying to follow the patterns to the letter without considering the context. Also the use of these patterns is not compulasry and simpler code could be better option depending on the context.
